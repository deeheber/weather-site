# Weather Site

## Description

Inspired by [isitsnowinginpdx.com](http://isitsnowinginpdx.com/).
See [blog post](https://www.danielleheberling.xyz/blog/serverless-weather-reporting/) for more details.

This is a workflow that:

1. Gets the current website status for a specified location
2. Hits the [open weather map API](https://openweathermap.org/) to get the current weather conditions
3. If #1 and #2 are different üëâüèª update the website with the current weather conditions

My deployment of this site is [here](http://www.isitsnowinginhillsboro.com/).

**The weather is happening site looks like this**

## Instructions to run

### Prerequisites

1. Install Node.js
2. Ensure you have an AWS account, install the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html), and [configure your credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html)
3. Get an API key from [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3)

### Steps

1. Clone the repo
2. [Create a Secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/create_secret.html) in Secrets Manager titled `weather-site-api-key` with a plaintext secret value that is your OpenWeather API key. Save the secret ARN for step #2.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Fill in the missing `SECRETS_EXTENSION_ARN` using the commented URL in `.env.example` to grab the correct ARN for your region. Add your copied ARN from the secret you created in step #1 for `WEATHER_SECRET_ARN`. Uncomment and add an email address to `ALERT_EMAIL`, if you'd like to receive an email notification if the state machine has two failed executions within 1 hour (totally optional). Update any other values if you don't want the default values.
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `export AWS_PROFILE=<your_aws_profile>`
   - Optional if you have a default profile or use `--profile` instead
6. Run `npm run deploy`
7. If not using a custom domain, the generated CloudFront URL will output to the console. This is where your website is.

### Custom Domain

- If your domain is not hosted in Route53, you'll also need to point your nameservers at Route53. [Directions here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/MigratingDNS.html)
- Certificates used for CloudFront have to be in the `us-east-1` region. I could've set this up with [cross region references](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_certificatemanager-readme.html#cross-region-certificates), but decided to throw an error for now if a domain name is present and not deploying into `us-east-1`. Contributions are welcome to make this better!

### Cleanup

If you want to delete the resources created by this project, run `npm run destroy`. Delete the secret that you created in the Secrets Manager console.

### Tests

There's some super basic tests in the `test` folder. To run them, run `npm run test`.
