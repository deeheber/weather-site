# Weather Site

## Description

Inspired by [isitsnowinginpdx.com](http://isitsnowinginpdx.com/).
See [blog post](https://www.danielleheberling.xyz/blog/serverless-weather-reporting/) for more details.

This is a workflow that:

1. Gets the current website status for a specified location
2. Hits the [open weather map API](https://openweathermap.org/) to get the current weather conditions
3. If #1 and #2 are different üëâüèª update the website with the current weather conditions

My deployment of this site is [here](http://www.isitsnowinginhillsboro.com/).
