# Weather Site

**This repo is a work in progress**

## Description

Inspired by [isitsnowinginpdx.com](http://isitsnowinginpdx.com/), this is a workflow that:

1. Gets the current website status for a specified location
2. Hits the [open weather map API](https://openweathermap.org/) to get the current weather conditions
3. If #1 and #2 are different üëâüèª update the website with the current weather conditions
